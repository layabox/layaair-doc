Skybox Sky Box is the sky in the 3D world. At present, there are two kinds of common sky boxes: cubic and spherical. The cube type is more commonly used.

The box skybox is made up of a cube model and six seamless texture maps, which is somewhat similar to 360 panoramic maps. With the rotation of the viewing angle, we can see that there are prospective effects in all directions. The sphere is simpler.
