Simplify the custom Shader process and remove the parameters associated with the wizard and material macro definitions in the SubShader constructor

Adding multi-light source support, scene can add any number of multiple light sources of any type at the same time

-**Instructions for upgrading**
After upgrading, the macro definition is changed from the original number to the ShaderDefine type, and the acquisition macro definition is changed from the original registerDefine function to the static Shader3D.getDefineByName function, which is more simple to use. You can refer to the latest custom Shader case on the official website.

Three light structure attributes in lighting.glsl are modified to lowercase

Upgraded Shader precompiler recommends using compileShaderByDefineNames. Macro definition characters are more stable than compileShader Mask values, and will not change values due to the adjustment of registration order.

The new engine will turn on multi-source rendering mode by default. If you want to roll back to single-source mode, you can modify Config3D.enbaleMultiLight to false.

The new version removes the restriction that the IOS Wechat Platform cannot merge GPU Instance.
